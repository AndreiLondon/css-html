        .product-container {
            position: relative;
            display: inline-block;
        }

        .product-image {
            width: 220px;

        /*
        position: relative;: This property specifies the positioning 
        context for the element. When an element has position: relative;, 
        it establishes a new positioning context for its child elements. 
        This means that any child elements positioned absolutely 
        inside .product-container will be positioned relative to it. 
        In other words, their position will be calculated based on 
        the top, right, bottom, and left properties 
        relative to the .product-container.
        
        display: inline-block;: This property determines how the element 
        is displayed within the document flow. inline-block is a display 
        value that combines features of inline and block-level elements. 
        It allows the element to flow inline like text (allowing other 
        elements to be on the same line) while still maintaining block-level 
        properties like setting width, height, margins, and paddings.
        
        So, when you apply .product-container to an HTML element, 
        it will have the following characteristics:
        
        The element will act like an inline-level element, meaning 
        it can be placed alongside other inline elements within 
        the same line of text.
        
        However, it will also behave like a block-level element 
        in terms of how you can set its dimensions (width and height), 
        margins, paddings, and other box-related properties.
        
        It establishes a positioning context, which can affect 
        how absolutely positioned child elements are placed relative to it.
        
        This combination of position: relative; and display: 
        inline-block; is often used when you want to create a container 
        for a specific component (like a product card) and have control 
        over its dimensions and positioning. Additionally, the position: relative; 
        is particularly useful if you plan to use absolute positioning 
        for certain elements inside the container, as it provides a 
        reference point for their positioning.
